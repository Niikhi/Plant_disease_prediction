The project begins by downloading a dataset from Kaggle containing images of various plant diseases and healthy plants. The dataset is then extracted and loaded into the project environment.

Next, the code preprocesses the images, setting parameters for image size and batch size, and creates image generators for both training and validation data.

A convolutional neural network (CNN) model is built using TensorFlow and Keras. This model consists of convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers and dense layers. The output layer has a softmax activation function to predict the probability of each class.

The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function. It is then trained using the training data and validated using the validation data for 5 epochs.

After training, the model's performance is evaluated on the validation set, achieving an accuracy of approximately 87.86%.

Finally, the model is saved as an HDF5 file for future use in predicting plant diseases.

Overall, this project demonstrates how deep learning techniques can be applied to classify plant diseases based on images, providing a valuable tool for early detection and management of plant diseases in agriculture.
